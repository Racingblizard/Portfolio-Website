      <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
      <p>
        I build clean, responsive web interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        With React, I create interactive user experiences that combine 
        functionality with design. My focus is always on simplicity, 
        usability, and writing code that adapts across devices for modern users.

      <h3>Hardware & Software Repair</h3>
      <p>
        Skilled in diagnosing and fixing computer and phone hardware issues, 
        I can replace parts, repair systems, and configure software. 
        This practical expertise allows me to solve real-world technical problems 
        and support both individuals and teams with reliable solutions.

        and Linux command line operations. These skills strengthen my ability

      <h3>Photography & Management</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond technology, I enjoy photography and managing office workflows. 
        This mix of creativity and organizational skills helps me balance 
        technical work with human connections, teamwork, and presentation. 
        It also shapes how I tell stories visually and professionally.
